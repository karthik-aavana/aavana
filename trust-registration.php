									Before getting into the details of the procedure of <strong>Registering trust,</strong> you must first have a basic understanding of a trust.
								</p>
								<p>
									Trusts play a very important role in the development of a country. During situations where the government fails to be of help, trusts and NGO’s take up the responsibility.

								<span class="title-border"></span>
								<p>
									Most people set up a trust with the purpose of getting involved in charitable activities and also acquiring certain benefits. Trust registrations also help in tax exemption. Charitable trusts are nonprofit organizations. However, to benefit from all these advantages, the charitable trust should have a legal entity.
								</p>
								<p>
									The formation of every trust involves the <a href="partnership-registration" class="link">Registration of a deed.</a> Therefore, the Charitable Trust Registration is also referred to as a trust deed.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are quite a few resources provided by The Federal and State Law Departments in India to guide the charitable organizations and the common people. Donors not only get the tax benefits but also the hope to pass the assets on to their legal heirs. This is the reason donors become interested in investing their assets in a reputable trust organization.
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="company-registration-india" class="link">Registering a firm
									</a> as a charitable trust requires you to have some basic knowledge about how to set up a new trust in terms of its registration, the requirements for registration and the fees payable for the Registration are concerned. Both, the Federal and the State authorities have set up their system of registration of charitable trusts.
