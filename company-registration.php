									<strong>A company</strong> is a legal entity that is formed by a group of people who engage themselves in the operation of a business. The line of business that the company chooses will determine the type of entity that the business will choose.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Company registration</strong> is the registration of the organization under the jurisdiction they operate. Depending on the nature of your business, your company can be owned by a single person or a group of people.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you’re running a business which does not have an identity, there is a high chance of you as an owner, losing the unique name of your business to a person who has already got his company registered. You won’t be able to legally sue the person for this act. Company Registration will avoid such situations and also serves as an authentic proof for your business.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Are you all set to start your next business venture?</strong> <strong>Company Registration</strong>  can be a stressful task. However, registering your company legally will avoid unpleasant situations and safeguard your Business. Trust the experienced professionals at Aavana to get the job done. We can also handle all firm registrations online as well.
