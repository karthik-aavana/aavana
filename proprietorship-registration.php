									<h3 class="title text-center"><span>Different Ways to register your Sole Proprietorship Registration</span></h3>
									<span class="title-border"></span>
									<p>
										There is no such hard and fast rule laid by the government of India to register a sole proprietorship firm. It must be formulated through tax registrations or business registrations in the name of the owner or Proprietor to confirm that he/she is operating the business. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This would make the Proprietor liable for all the liabilities of Proprietorship firm registration. As the owner and sole proprietorship are the same, taxation rules are simple and the income earned by this business is that of the owner and taxes are paid on the profits earned by the sole proprietorship.
