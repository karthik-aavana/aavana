									Corporation tax is nothing but the tax that is imposed on the net income of a particular company. All companies which include <a href="private-limited-company-registration-formation" class="link">Private</a> and <a href="public-limited-company-registration" class="link">Public Companies</a> , registered under the Companies Act, 1956 must pay corporate tax.

								</p>
								<p>
									This corporate tax has been recently reduced by the Indian government, with the aim to make India globally competitive, induce domestic and Foreign Investment and boost the country’s export sector.
