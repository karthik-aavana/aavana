									<a href="https://aavana.in/blog/how-to-register-llp/" class="link">Limited liability partnership</a> or LLP is a combination of both <a href="https://aavana.in/partnership-registration
									" class="link">partnership</a> and corporation. It has the feature of both these forms. As the name suggests partners have limited liability in the company which means that personal assets of the partners are not used for paying off the debts of the company.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many entrepreneurs are opting for this business structure. Everyone is liable for their own acts. There are a number of partners in the firm and hence they are not liable or responsible for others misconduct. All limited liability partnership is governed under the limited liability partnership act of 2008. However, in India LLP was introduced in April 2009. 
								</p>
								<p>
									An LLP is a separate legal entity distinct from its owners. It can enter into a contract and acquire property in its name. LLP form is not just prevailing in India. It is also seen in countries like the United Kingdom, Australia etc.
