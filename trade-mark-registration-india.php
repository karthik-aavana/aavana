									Trademark has become an essential part of today’s highly competitive world. It builds the goodwill and the reputation and assists in differentiating the products sold by you with that of other business. Trademark registration is governed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademark, Ministry of Commerce and Industry under the Trademark Act, 1999. Once registered a Trademark is valid for 10 years from the date of filing which can be renewed.

										<strong>Legal Protection</strong>
										<p>
											Trademark gives you legal protection. After getting your Trademark registered, your brand is completely protected. The proprietor has every right to take action or sue for the damages caused by any third party.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Brand Value</strong>
										<p>
											It enhances the brand value of your business. Trade is an intangible asset for a company. It is a part of the intellectual property of the company. A registered trademark can be sold, transferred or licensed to generate revenue.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Build Trust and Goodwill</strong>
										<p>
											Customers prefer to buy products that have a registered trademark. The customers feel more secure about the reliability of the brand.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Acts as Brand Identity</strong>
										<p>
											A trademark registered acts as a brand identity. Since your brand has its own identity no one can register a company in the same name or with similar business class.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Intangible Assets</strong>
										<p>
											Trademark registration has its own valuation at the time of merger or demerger of the company. Hence it is considered as an intangible asset.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Use of ® symbol</strong>
									</li>
									<p>
										Once your trademark is registered, you can use ® symbol on your logo which states that the trademark has been registered and it prohibits anyone from using the same trademark. If the trademark is used by another person, then the owner of the business can sue the person.
									</p>
									<li>
										<strong>Global Trademark Registration</strong>
									</li>
									<p>
										If you’re willing to expand your business outside India then the trademark registered in India serves as a good base along with the established goodwill in the country.
