									Copyright Registration in India
								</p>
								<p>
									Aavana is one of the leading consultants for providing end-to-end financial services. Having our head office in Bangalore, we have PAN India presence. We have subject experts who can guide you from filling of the application to the final process of getting the copyright registration not only in Bangalore but all over India.
								</p>
								<p>
									Copyright is an intellectual property right conferred upon the owner for his/her original works. A copyright can be books, movie scripts, songs, recordings or anything for that matter that is original in nature. Nobody else can use the original works of the owner without his/her consent in writing.
								</p>
								<p>
									The owner of the copyright can sue if he/she finds that their work has been violated. This right was initiated by the government under The Copyright Act of 1957 in order to safeguard the interest of the curators. The protection given by the copyright creates an atmosphere conducive to creativity, which leads them to create more such original works and motivates others too.

										<li>
											<strong>Work gets Public Attention -</strong>  One of the important benefits of copyright registration is that your work gets noticed by the public around the world. It becomes a searchable aspect in the copyright registry database.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Legal Protection -</strong>Once the copyright of your work is registered it gives legal protection of your work. It ultimately safeguards your work and prevents others not to use without your authorization.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Viability of the work </strong>Copyright Registration of your work avoids any future challenges regarding your work if the registration is done within five years of publication.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Claim for damages</strong> You can claim for damages and attorney fees if you find that your copyright work has been infringed by someone. You can also sue the person to the court of law for violation.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Copyright is an asset</strong> It creates intellectual property for the owner. It is considered to be an intangible asset and can be sold or franchised.
