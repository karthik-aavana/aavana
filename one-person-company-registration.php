									<!-- <strong>One person company registration</strong> is made easy when you choose Aavana. Our honest and friendly staff will answer all your queries and take you through the registration process. -->

								<p>
									<strong>OPC Registration</strong> as the name denotes is a company which can be run by a single person. According to the Companies Act of 2013, any person aspiring to become an entrepreneur can go ahead and start a new single ownership company also known as One Person Company.
								</p>	
								<p>
									<a href="https://aavana.in/blog/what-is-a-one-person-company/" class="link">One Person Company</a> is ideally suited for Entrepreneurs and Proprietors who cannot avail the benefits of limited liability due to the non-availability of finding a second member or a shareholder. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The concept of One Person Company is a form of business enabling Entrepreneur(s) carrying on the business in the <a href="https://aavana.in/proprietorship-registration" class="link">Sole-Proprietor</a> form of business to enter into a Corporate Framework.
								</p>
								<p>
									The last name of the company ends with the word (OPC) Private Limited.
